# Smart Voice Lock - Wiring Schematic

This file describes the wiring for the Smart Voice Lock project.

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- HC-05 Bluetooth Module
- SG90 Servo Motor
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Power source (USB or 9V battery)

## Connections


### Notes
- Ensure the HC-05 is powered with 5V from Arduino (some modules may require 3.3V logic; add a voltage divider if needed).
- Servo VCC can be connected to Arduino 5V for simplicity, but use an external power source if multiple servos are added.
- Double-check polarity to avoid damaging components.
